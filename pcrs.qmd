## When To Fill Out 

For any patient for whom you perform a medical assessment or intervention beyond simple First Aid (i.e. anything beyond handing out a band-aid or ice pack).

## When Not To?

Simple First Aid or comfort items requested by patients (i.e. band-aids, ice packs) who refuse and/or do not require assessment.

## Key Takeaways / Common Mistakes

- Demographics information is required for every patient. Try your best to acquire it.  
  _Pro Tip: Ask for their ID!_
- Chief complaint should be in quotes (e.g., “I drank too much,” not _EtOH_). If unresponsive or incomprehensible, document as:  
  > “None (Unresponsive/Incomprehensible)”
- If A+O status is less than 4, document exactly what the patient could not report or what led you to conclude the patient was altered.  
  _E.g.: “Unaware of current location/city”_
- In systems assessment, document both signs and symptoms and pertinent negatives.  
  _E.g.: Cardiovascular: “Pedal edema.” Neurological: “CSMs in all extremities intact.”_
- Know the difference between WNL and NA:  
  - Use WNL (Within Normal Limits) if the system is relevant and you have assessed it to be normal.  
  - Use NA (Not Applicable/Assessed) if the system is irrelevant to the call.
- For allergies, medications, and past medical history:  
  If none reported, do not leave blank. Write:  
  > “None reported/Pt denies”

## Narrative Structure

All PCRs should follow this general format:

> MRC [1] [dispatched/flagged down] to/for [“X YOM/F”] @ [Location]
> AOS (Arrived on Scene) to find [X YOM/F]… initial impressions (positioning, A+O status, ABCs, skin signs, etc.)… with Chief Complaint: [“____”]  
> Upon assessment, document all relevant signs, symptoms, assessment responses, and pertinent negatives. Skip items that are already clearly documented elsewhere.  
> _If applicable_: ALS requested via [UCPD emergency line/911/radio] @ [time]. Mention immediately if done on arrival.  
> Transferred care to [BER (Berkeley Fire) Engine/Medic #] or “Pt released after treatment and refused additional service.”  
> _If releasing pt_: include rationale for safe release without ALS.  
> _If moving pt_: “Pt securely loaded onto [gurney/stair chair] and moved to [destination] without incident.”

## Signatures

- **Patient Signature**: MUST be obtained, or document why not obtained.  
  _If minor/ALOC/AMS_: “Pt unable to sign (reason).” A guardian or chaperone may sign if legally permitted.
- **Provider Signature**: All providers involved in care must sign and approve the PCR.

## Acronyms
