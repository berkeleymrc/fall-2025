    "text": "Course Structure\n\nWeekly Topics\nEach week will focus on a different emergency medicine topic or feature a guest speaker. Class time includes student-led presentations and scenarios.\n\n\nAttendance\nClasses are held Mondays or Tuesdays from 6–8pm. In-person attendance at one of the two weekly sessions is required unless excused for illness or emergency. Attendance is recorded via iClicker. A maximum of two unexcused absences is allowed. During excused absences, Zoom recordings and a makeup assignment will be provided if available.\n\n\nReadings\nBrief primers (1–2 pages) will be shared as PDFs on bCourses prior to each class. Where readings are TBD or a guest speaker is scheduled, relevant material will be provided one week in advance. These may include news articles, research, or student-made primers.\n\n\nPresentations\nStarting the second class, students will sign up for a topic and work in groups of 2–5. They will research, prepare a 40–60 minute interactive presentation, and develop three EMT-level case scenarios. Preparation includes slide review with facilitators, and teams are expected to rehearse in advance. The estimated workload is 8 hours.\nNon-presenting students will take notes and submit a post-class reflection through bCourses, listing three takeaways or questions. Students will also complete two mid-semester feedback forms and a final reflection.\n\n\nScenarios and Quizzes\nShort scenario-based quizzes will be posted on bCourses each week. After the submission deadline, full solutions will be provided.\n\n\nEMS Engagement\nStudents are required to participate in at least 3 EMS engagement opportunities outside the classroom, such as event staffing through BMRC or Rock Medicine, ride-alongs and ambulance work, or teaching public health classes. Those unable to do so should contact instructors as soon as possible to complete alternative method of engagement.",

    "text": "I am not currently an EMT, can I still enroll in the course?  No. Emergency Medicine in Practice is open only to BMRC members, who must be Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians with California State licensure (grey card).\nThat said, non-EMTs are still welcome and encouraged to attend our public presentations from 7–8 PM on Mondays and Tuesdays. These are a great way to learn more about what it’s like to be an EMT and a BMRC member. For more details, check out our Instagram (@mrcberkeley).\nWill there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?  No. Lectures are in-person only and will not be streamed or recorded. Attendance is expected.\nDo you have a Covid (or other illness) policy?  Yes. If you’re feeling unwell or have been recently exposed to illness, please stay home. If you expect to miss class due to illness, email [admin?] to let them know.\nAre time conflicts allowed?  No, if you will be consistently missing a portion of training due to another class, you should not enroll.",

It will look something like calendarID@group.calendar.google.com.\nFor example, in the embed URL https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com, calendarID@group.calendar.google.com is the part you need.\n\nCreate a Single Embed Link:\n\nUse the base URL for embedding multiple calendars: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?\nAppend each calendar ID to the base URL using the format &src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com for each calendar you want to include.\nOptionally, you can customize the appearance by adding parameters (e.g., &color=%23F6BF26 for the color, &ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles for the time zone).\n\nFor example, if you have two calendars with IDs calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com and calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com, your combined embed link would look like this:\n\nhttps://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com&src=calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com\n\nSubstitute this URL into the src attribute of the calendar’s iframe at the top of this page."
