## What is Rock Medicine?

Rock Medicine is a volunteer-based event medicine organization that has provided free, non-judgmental medical care at California's largest concerts and festivals for over 50 years. Originally founded in partnership with the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics in the 1970s, Rock Med was built on the idea that high-quality care should be available without cost or judgment.

Rock Med aims to treat and support patients in a way with priority placed on getting them home safely. They do not involve billing, insurance, or unnecessary emergency department visits.

At each event, teams are composed of licensed physicians, nurses, EMTs, paramedics, PAs, NPs, and trained CPR volunteers. Most events operate with Advanced Life Support (ALS) capabilities, and volunteers treat a wide range of trauma and medical calls, from minor injuries to altered mental status. Rock Med is typically first on scene within the venue, and coordinates with 911 when hospital transport is necessary.
