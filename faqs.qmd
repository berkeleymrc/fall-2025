__I am not currently an EMT, can I still enroll in the course?__ <br>
No. Emergency Medicine in Practice is open only to BMRC members, who must be Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians with California State licensure (grey card).

That said, non-EMTs are still welcome and encouraged to attend our public presentations from 7–8 PM on Mondays and Tuesdays. These are a great way to learn more about what it’s like to be an EMT and a BMRC member. For more details, check out our Instagram  ([@mrcberkeley](https://www.instagram.com/mrcberkeley/)).


__Will there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?__ <br>
No. Lectures are in-person only and will not be streamed or recorded. Attendance is expected.


__Do you have a Covid (or other illness) policy?__ <br>
Yes. If you're feeling unwell or have been recently exposed to illness, please stay home. If you expect to miss class due to illness, email [admin?] to let them know.


__Are time conflicts allowed?__ <br>
No, if you will be consistently missing a portion of training due to another class, you should not enroll.
