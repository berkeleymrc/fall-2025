    "text": "Course Structure\n\nWeekly Topics\nEach week will focus on a different emergency medicine topic or feature a guest speaker. Class time includes student-led presentations and scenarios.\n\n\nAttendance\nClasses are held Mondays or Tuesdays from 6–8pm. In-person attendance at one of the two weekly sessions is required unless excused for illness or emergency. Attendance is recorded via iClicker. A maximum of two unexcused absences is allowed. During excused absences, Zoom recordings and a makeup assignment will be provided if available.\n\n\nReadings\nBrief primers (1–2 pages) will be shared as PDFs on bCourses prior to each class. Where readings are TBD or a guest speaker is scheduled, relevant material will be provided one week in advance. These may include news articles, research, or student-made primers.\n\n\nPresentations\nStarting the second class, students will sign up for a topic and work in groups of 2–5. They will research, prepare a 40–60 minute interactive presentation, and develop three EMT-level case scenarios. Preparation includes slide review with facilitators, and teams are expected to rehearse in advance. The estimated workload is 8 hours.\nNon-presenting students will take notes and submit a post-class reflection through bCourses, listing three takeaways or questions. Students will also complete two mid-semester feedback forms and a final reflection.\n\n\nScenarios and Quizzes\nShort scenario-based quizzes will be posted on bCourses each week. After the submission deadline, full solutions will be provided.\n\n\nEMS Engagement\nStudents are required to participate in at least 3 EMS engagement opportunities outside the classroom, such as event staffing through BMRC or Rock Medicine, ride-alongs and ambulance work, or teaching public health classes. Those unable to do so should contact instructors as soon as possible to complete alternative method of engagement.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "I am not currently an EMT, can I still enroll in the course?  No, Emergency Medicine in Practice is only open to enrollment by BMRC members, who are required to be Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians and hold California State licensure (grey card). Non EMTs are still welcome and encouraged to join us at from 7-8pm on Mondays and Tuesdays to watch presentations and learn more about what being an EMT and a BMRC member is like. More information about these presentations is available on the BMRC instagram (@mrcberkeley).\n\nWill attendance be enforced?  Attending class and section contributes to achieving the learning outcomes of this course. You should attend every class and section to the best of your abilities, but I understand that extenuating circumstances arise. If you cannot attend a class or section, please stay on track with the covered materials.\nOn a side note, here’s one fun fact from the students’ course evaluations. The most common answer provided by the students when asked “What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?” is: “Go to all the lectures and start working on assignments early.”\n\nWill there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?  (No) Unless Campus authorities decide to switch to remote instruction, there won’t be live webcast or live zoom recordings. With that said, lectures may be recorded for archival purposes, but not necessarily be shared with the class.\n\nDo you have a Covid (or other illness) policy?  Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted either in this website or in bCourses. Likewise, you’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by office hours to chat with the GSI, the tutor, or the instructor.\nHaving said that, we expect you to attend lecture and lab. Past experience tells us that students who constantly miss lecture/lab tend to have a mediocre performance.\nAlso, missing lecture/lab does not give you the right to use OH as a replacement for receiving instruction. We are always willing to help you understand the learning materials during OH, but this also requires that you make an honest effort reviewing them before coming to OH.\n\nAre time conflicts allowed?  No, if you will be consistently missing a portion of training due to another class, you should not enroll.",

It will look something like calendarID@group.calendar.google.com.\nFor example, in the embed URL https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com, calendarID@group.calendar.google.com is the part you need.\n\nCreate a Single Embed Link:\n\nUse the base URL for embedding multiple calendars: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?\nAppend each calendar ID to the base URL using the format &src=calendarID@group.calendar.google.com for each calendar you want to include.\nOptionally, you can customize the appearance by adding parameters (e.g., &color=%23F6BF26 for the color, &ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles for the time zone).\n\nFor example, if you have two calendars with IDs calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com and calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com, your combined embed link would look like this:\n\nhttps://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendar1ID@group.calendar.google.com&src=calendar2ID@group.calendar.google.com\n\nSubstitute this URL into the src attribute of the calendar’s iframe at the top of this page."
